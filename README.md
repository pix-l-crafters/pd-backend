## Recommendations

### Configuration directory

If this project is a tool, CLI, or library that reads its own configuration,
support resolving it from a project-level `.config/` directory
(e.g. `.config/pocket-draw-backend.toml`) alongside
any other locations you accept. It keeps consumers' repo roots tidy and follows
an emerging cross-ecosystem convention:

- <https://github.com/numtide/prj-spec> — project directory specification
- <https://dot-config.github.io/> — the `.config/` directory convention
- <https://github.com/pi0/config-dir> — reference implementation for resolving it
